# ZeroTuch

This reposetory dose not describe my sex life but how we can deploy Cisco switcher and router with ZeroTuch

The goal is to load the right configuration and right ios on to  device freah from the box.

There is two mathos available, one puch based the another pull based.

With the pusheed based we load a default configuration on the device and pushes ios and device specific configuration to the device. 
With the pull based we make the switch connaction the server to get the right ios and device specific configuration. 


There is DHCP server to load the default configuration
There is also a service with the device specific configuration and IOS files.
